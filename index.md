# Kids and Teachers being sick all the time is not good

COVID-19 has weakened people's immune systems to many diseases (Flu, RSV, Staph, Strep, Measles). We have to lower transmission in schools as kids bring it home to parents and it just keeps taking its turn with other principally airborne pathogens. We **know exactly how to do this** _without_ putting everyone in masks or making people attend school remotely (or lockdowns again).

## COVID is airborne (a fact suppressed at the start)

Given we now know **COVID-19 is airborne** and even the WHO has accepted that with a long "airborne risk assessment" for COVID-19 [(*)](https://iris.who.int/handle/10665/376346), the world slowly pivots to airborne disease transmission mitigations. In March of 2024, after the publication of the WHO document, 33 professors and PhDs pushing for a policy change in an article on **Science.org**: [Mandating indoor air quality for public buildings](https://drive.google.com/file/d/16l_IH47cQtC7fFuafvHca7ORNVGITxx8/view).

Know that other diseases are airborne too: Measles (studies [1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2810934/pdf/10982072.pdf) [2](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3880795/pdf/nihms532643.pdf) [3](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31257413/) [4](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0196655316305363)), Influenza, RSV and TB. The same ventilation and air filtration measures reduce transmission of those too.

## Ventilation work for schools

Better ventilate schools for long term student and teacher health is the push, but need to track the progress for that in in each country. We should do so ahead of government effort to do the same. If government starts to track this work, this effort will continue because that effort might might be weak. The published Science.org article above highlights schools as a key place for active ventilation work. That should should be mechanical heat recovery ventilation (MHRV)  in this age. It also means air filtration/cleaning too, and CO2 monitoring to drive ventilation levels, as CO2 inside is a proxy indicator for COVID-19 transmission risk. As it happens the WHO document details all of these, too.

## Healthy full attendance at school

 When we say student and teacher health, we're wanting absences to go down too. A prior tactic on absences from school was forcing sick people to attend. If we lower transmission in schools, we increase attendance. We also reduce multi-generation transmission outside schools too. Kids were bringing COVID-19 home and infecting their parents and grandparents. With lowered transmission, we also reduce long COVID, where the worst sufferers have disappeared from eduction and may be unable to earn a living for the rest of their lives.

# Action Plan

What to do is **ventilate schools** and there are a number of articles about it:

* [Healthy indoor air is our fundamental need: the time to act is now](https://www.mja.com.au/journal/2022/217/11/healthy-indoor-air-our-fundamental-need-time-act-now) - 2022, Professors Lidia Morawska, Guy B Marks and Jason Monty
* [Designing infectious disease resilience into school buildings through improvements to ventilation and air cleaning](https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5ef3652ab722df11fcb2ba5d/t/60a3d1251fcec67243e91119/1621348646314/Safe+Work+TF+Desigining+infectious+disease+resilience+April+2021.pdf) 2021, by THE LANCET COVID-19 COMMISSION 
* [John Snow Project on the CDC's standards for air in schools](https://johnsnowproject.org/primers/new-cdc-standards-of-air-hygiene/). JohnSnowProject.com is a group effort
* [Clean Air Crew on school ventilation](https://cleanaircrew.org/schools/). CleanAirCrew.org is a group effort

We know we can't eliminate transmission in schools - we're just aiming for "lower chance of spread" which would be a reproduction number "RO" under 1.0 per infected student or teacher. [Google search for RO](https://www.google.com/search?q=r0+Basic+reproduction+number)

## School Ventilation Ideals

The Center for Green Schools (CfGS) has a number of resources for their, including an hour-long video on "Unanswered Questions on ASHRAE standard 241 and CDC Ventilation Standard Guidance for Schools": 

[![Unanswered Questions on ASHRAE standard 241 and CDC Ventilation Standard Guidance for Schools](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GOPPh_QboAAfgcY?format=jpg&name=900x900)](https://s3.amazonaws.com/usgbc_videos/mp4/FINAL_+ASHRAE+and+CDC.mp4)

Twenty-nine minutes in, there's a discussion on air filtration instead of fresh air ventilation for cash-strapped schools. The ASHRAE 241 standard understands the economic constraints of the larger school air quality goals.

ASHRAE 241 refers to a standard published by the American Society of Heating, Refrigerating and Air-Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE). Specifically, ASHRAE 241-2019 is titled "Standard for Ventilation and Acceptable Indoor Air Quality in Residential Buildings. ASHRAE 241-2019 supersedes the previous version, ASHRAE Standard 62.2-2016. 

CfGS's [25-page toolkit](https://www.usgbc.org/sites/default/files/2024-05/CFGS_IAQ-Toolkit-2024.pdf) is excellent. Their [home page](https://centerforgreenschools.org/).

### A stylized classroom

|:-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------:| 
| Blueprint depiction of classroom, with false ceiling tiles removed, and A, B & C denoting placement of equipment. |

### What we need to do

Better classrooms are already sealed against outside heat, cold and pollution. Depending on the latitude, some air conditioning, too.

<!--Comment:  &#8322; is the number two in subscript for CO2 -->

1. Increased fresh air ventilation (heat recovering\*) out through walls (**A**) or ducted at the ceiling level (existing or new).
2. Freestanding (**B**) air cleaning equipment. Equipment can be DIY (see below) or commercial.
  * or above the ceiling tiles (**C**).
  * or through the ceiling to roof mounted (**C**) if there is a flat roof above.
3. Monitoring of carbon dioxide (CO&#8322;), which is a "proxy risk" indicator of air that could be carrying viruses from infected people to uninfected people ([Pick a study from Google search results](https://www.google.com/search?q=carbon+dioxide+as+a+proxy+risk+indicator+for+covid19)). The level of CO&#8322; would drive the settings of the ventilation and filtering systems. Only gadgets that use NDIR sensors should be used. Wall mounted or above ceiling tiles, too.
4. We also need legislation that requires the completion of such work in classrooms. The legislation should also certify that the work has been done, inspections happen that the work is correct, and has measures to intervene if the work is not correct.
5. Make it safe in schools for those wanting to wear masks (kids or teachers). We're not going to recommend masks for everyone in a school setting - this site is about pushing for long term ventilation, air filtration/cleaning, and CO&#8322; monitoring to drive those.

**We should not wait for #4 before getting started on #1, #2, and #3.**

Ideally 1 & 2 are engineered solutions, fitted build expert and licensed building contractors. You don't have to wait - freestanding works to fill a gap, and the DIY options are cheap an effective. They are cheap enough to be donated by parent groups. See the *5th Graders Make..* video, below.

Note: Ionization of the air is not recommended as it creates ozone. Ozone being harmful to people. Upper room ultraviolet technology may play a part in virus inactivation as the technology reaches mass production.

### CO&#8322; as proxy risk

CO&#8322; builds up as occupants of a room breathe in and out. When occupants leave a room for the final time in a day, CO&#8322; naturally decays towards the outside air concentration (420 parts per million if you're in the countryside). This decay is just slow exchange with lower CO&#8322; ppm air through tiny gaps in walls, windows, and a big gap under the door:

![](images/co2-levels.png)

If the windows are open then CO&#8322; will not build up so fast, but there has to be an air currant to force air through the room. Over a hundred years ago, Florence Nightingale [campaigned for decades](https://www.google.com/search?q=Florence+Nightingale+stale+air) for windows to be opened to reduce airborne disease transmission in public buildings. She also campaigned for high ceilings those buildings. Because of the open windows, buildings had to have dialed-up heating systems that would be very expensive today, so we prefer mechanical heat recovery ventilation (MHRV) and energy recovery ventilation (ERV) systems. We can now also scrub the air of viruses (suspended in one-micron size water vapor aerosols) using air filters and cleaners. There are DIY alternatives that are just as good. Air filters do not address the CO&#8322; levels themselves, which can contribute to drowsiness on its own at very high levels. Air filters do address smoke particles from nearby cars and truck exhausts and pollen, though.

## Mapping the world's schools

### Proof of concept: Wales

EXPERIMENT: While we prove the concepts of this particular initiative, we are focusing only on Wales within the UK for now, as it is a small amount of schools and we can gauge community participation in this effort.

**[See a list of schools in Wales](/Wales/)** You've invited to help edit the data within. We have some [](/contributing-and-rules/)

### Other Countries?

Other countries may be listed right here later on. Or states/provinces, or even cities if the list of schools would be too large otherwise. Each of these would need (say) ten people willing to oversee the setup and curation of each school's page. Some of those people should be people with a bunch of GitHub skills - maybe software developers who're covid-is-airborne savvy and have kids themselves. Or a school's IT teacher who doesn't want to get reinfected with COVID again.

Again, if Welsh schools get some traction on this site, we will be open to other countries For now we just want every Welsh school graded, then some of them moving in the right direction, before working out if we launch a campaign for more areas of the world.
