title: Covid is Airborne
---

Given we now know **COVID-19 is airborne** and even the WHO has accepted that with a long "airborne risk assessment" for COVID-19 [(*)](https://iris.who.int/handle/10665/376346), the world is slowly pivoting toward engineering to reduce airborne disease transmission. In March 2024, after the publication of the WHO document, 33 professors and PhDs pushed for a policy change in an article on **Science.org**: [Mandating indoor air quality for public buildings](https://drive.google.com/file/d/16l_IH47cQtC7fFuafvHca7ORNVGITxx8/view).

Know that other diseases are airborne too: Measles (studies [1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2810934/pdf/10982072.pdf) [2](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3880795/pdf/nihms532643.pdf) [3](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31257413/) [4](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0196655316305363)), Influenza, RSV, and TB. The same ventilation and air filtration measures reduce transmission of those too.
