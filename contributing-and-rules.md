# Rules / Code of Conduct

See something you want to fix? Here are the rules for contributing to this repository.

1. **Support our mission:** You should care about the fact that COVID-19 is airborne and that we can mitigate virus transmission by improving ventilation in indoor settings.
2. **Stay on topic:** Do not introduce other agenda items. While people may have differing views on vaccines, our focus is on ventilation, air filtration, and CO2 monitoring for schools. Leave vaccine discussions out of this platform.
3. **Be respectful:** Focus on the school ventilation aspect of this work and be courteous to each other and school officials. This applies to our online interactions, phone conversations, and in-person meetings. Read HBR's [How to Disagree with Someone More Powerful than You](https://hbr.org/2016/03/how-to-disagree-with-someone-more-powerful-than-you). Remember, school officials are under pressure too.
4. **Avoid overwhelming school officials:** Recognize that school officials are under significant pressure. Conduct your research without adding to their burden.
5. **Use appropriate channels:** If you have children in a school, use existing communication channels to gather information. If not, rely on online research and do not directly contact school officials.
6. **Cite authoritative sources:** Avoid personal anecdotes like "School principal Freddie told me they would never do X or Y." Instead, link to authoritative sources and document findings factually, e.g., "Focus group members raised the need to do X and Y on July 1st, 2024, without school agreement at that time."
7. **No doxing:** Do not share personal information about others without their consent. Read more about doxing [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doxing).
8. **Own your mistakes:** Be objective, acknowledge any errors, and be ready to correct or improve your contributions.
9. **Be accountable:** Do not use anonymity to behave inappropriately. Our goals are reasonable and legal, so use your real name if possible and always be polite.
10. **Seek language assistance if needed:** For dual language work, such as Welsh and English, seek help if necessary.
11. **Use Pull Requests:** Follow the GitHub workflow (explained below) to submit changes. Pull Requests are preferred over issues as they respect the maintainers' time.
12. **Maintain transparency in external efforts:** If you organize outside this GitHub repository, adhere to these rules (be respectful, no doxing) and link to your efforts. Be open to collaboration and cautious of infiltration by those opposing our goals.

## What is GitHub?

GitHub is a fundamental tool in software development. For us, it serves as the portal for editing and hosting the website. To edit school pages, create an account on [GitHub.com](https://github.com/signup) and log in. Contributions are reviewed through "Pull Requests," which are typically approved and live within minutes. Reviewers may suggest changes, which should be considered. Immediate minor edits by reviewers are also acceptable.

Learn more about why we use GitHub [here](/site-technologies/).

## Setting up GitHub

First, create an account on [GitHub.com](https://github.com), using a real name or a realistic pseudonym (e.g., SamWilliams1234). Choose the 'free' option during setup.
