# Tools for working on entries.

## Leaning a little about "Markdown"

When writing text the page pertinent to a single school, we're writing in a little language called Markdown.

**Here is how you you make links to another page online:**

```
[This link links to Google](https://google.com)
```

That looks like this [This link links to Google](https://google.com) when the site has been regenerated after a commit

All hyperlinks start with https:// Some older hyperlinks start with http:// (no s) but that's fewer and fewer over 
time.

## Google search to find answers

Searching for a school name to fill in the blanks is just fine. Try to worry about the authenticity of the site you 
have found. Know too that Wikipedia can be inaccurate for periods of time. This was a real moment in Wikipedia's
history: [many years of fake Scots language articles added without detection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scots_Wikipedia#:~:text=These%20articles%20have%20been%20described%20as%20%22English%20written%20in%20a%20Scottish%20accent%2C%22%20with%20gibberish%20and%20nonsensical%20words%20and%20spellings%20not%20present%20in%20any%20Scots%20dialect).

## Research

### Wikidata

There is a huge structured database online called [WikiData](wikidata.org). You find a school there, see lots of data for it, navigate 
to related nodes. For school systems like Boston in the USA, it is much more complete than for (say) Welsh schools.  It has 
its own query language, too, if you have some programming skills. https://w.wiki/9yVC is a query that shows the schools 
in Boston, and retrieves the wikipedia page URL and the School's own website. Well, it does if they are known in Wikidata
else that's blank. For the Welsh school data in WikiData there's no useful "Schools in Wales" node to use as the basis 
for a query. *Not yet*, that is, as anyone can furnish those missing facts. Wikipedia links for welsh schools there should
have links to en.wikipedia.org and cy.wikipedia.org when appropriate.  

### AIs and wiki-data

Microsoft's CoPilot AI has some understanding of
data that's held in Wikidata even if it cannot yet run it's own queries.  You could take the query string for Boston 
above and ask CoPilot to give you one which was "like this query but for Wales instead of Boston" (or your LEA). Not
as of May 2024 because of missing data, but one day there will be a query you can run.

### AIs in general

It is a bit hit ans miss at the moment if you wanted to get a listo of schools in and area, and also get secondary 
information for them like website URL.  Try Perplexity.AI, but note that the alternate AIs leap-frog each other from
one week to another.

### Google.com - Searching within a site

That best-ventilation school in Texas has a site: Abrome.com. Say it was too big to click around to navigate. You can 
ask Google to find a single page you might be looking for. Try this in Google's search bar: "ventilation site:https://www.abrome.com". 
You find a few links, mostly blog entries, but the first link is a policy page and that is exactly what we want.

### Search generally
